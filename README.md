# Project: Machine Learning for Crowd Modeling and Simulation (MLCMS in TUM informatics)
Machine learning (ML) crowd modeling and simulation refers to the use of machine learning techniques to understand, predict, and simulate the behavior of crowds in various scenarios. The motivation behind this field stems from the need to better comprehend and manage the complex dynamics that emerge when large groups of individuals interact in confined spaces, events, or public areas. This could range from analyzing pedestrian movement in urban spaces to predicting crowd behavior during emergencies or designing efficient crowd management strategies for events and public spaces.
